# CLAUDE.md — project context for Claude Code sessions

You are building the production backend for OMERTÀ, a multiplayer noir mafia RPG with Solana integration. The founder (Jorge) is non-technical: explain decisions plainly, and never assume he can debug — tests must prove things work.

## Ground rules
1. **`omerta-backend-spec.md` is the contract.** Every formula, table, and timer is specified there with production values. Do not invent mechanics or "improve" balance — the numbers were sim-audited.
2. **`src/rules.js` is generated, never edited.** Regenerate from the prototype via `tools/extract-rules.js` if v25+ ships.
3. **Server-authoritative always.** Client input is a choice, never a value. All randomness server-side and logged to `rng_audit`.
4. **Every value movement writes to `transactions`.** The §10.4 invariants are sacred: value transfers, it is never minted. Add invariant checks to tests when you add faucets/sinks.
5. **Lazy accrual, no global ticks** (§7.1). Any new time-based mechanic extends `src/accrual.js` inside the same pattern.
6. **One DB transaction per action**, row-locked via `withCharacter` (extend it for two-party actions in M3: lock both rows in a stable order to avoid deadlock).
7. Run `npm test` after every change; extend `test/smoke.js` (or add files) for every new endpoint — both success and gate-rejection paths.

## Where things stand
M1–M4 complete and tested (`npm test` runs all four journeys). M2 shipped the
economy: garage, workshop + consumables, trade goods on the deterministic price hash
(§7.11, SEED via `MARKET_SEED` env), rackets/assets with lazy income accrual, the
row-locked AMM swap, staking (real 14% APY), NFT gear mint, 12h buyback worker.

M3 shipped the social layer (`src/social.js`): gangs (found/join/leave/kick/promote,
roles are the command truth in `gang_members`), tribute + weekly family contracts
(`bumpFamilyTask` in game.js), wars (declare $10k / 30 min / lazy resolution on read,
winner takes 20% spoils + standing), turf seizure with live perks (docks/canal/brick
in crime, neon+cathedral in accrual, foundry in craft, ±5% goods prices), jumps (§7.6),
bounty escrow (never pays its poster), hit contracts (§7.7: search 3h → fire, chop = 40%
of the victim's REAL fleet), server-side death + estate (§7.9: heir row, prestige,
account survives, street dies — all one transaction), busting (§7.8), the escrowed
Exchange (deferred from M2; product rejected), notifications table + websocket gateway
(`/v1/ws`, channels me/streets/gang via the in-process `bus` in game.js), armory, and
the buyback's 50% family split by standing. `withTwoCharacters` locks both character
rows then both account rows, each in sorted-id order — keep that global lock order
(characters → accounts → gangs → singletons) for anything new.

M4 shipped the Kitchen + growth. `src/kitchen.js`: makings (rank-gated, drifting
prices), the lab ladder (top tiers burn $OMR), cook → collect (one batch, crates
1/20 units, prod = demo×12, fire vs weighted-avg quality), deal (demand × quality ×
event × trade-rank bonus, heat, nerve 1/10, trade_rep on gross), crew hire, laylow,
clean papers. Crew sales + Bureau raids run inside §7.1 accrual (crew sells cheapest
lines at 80% of base×quality offline; raids roll 1−(1−p)^minutes past heat 60).
`src/growth.js`: paths ($10k first / 25 $OMR switch), the Daily Score (8h), missions
(pay once; $OMR rewards are an enumerated legal faucet; titles), daily contracts
(3 drawn by `(day+2i) mod pool`, all-three bonus pays 0.5 $OMR from the fund),
First Week with server-side checks (`src/verify.js` — SOCIAL_VERIFY_MODE off|trust|live,
production must run `live`), wallet link. Referrals (§7.13) qualify post-commit in
their own sorted-lock transaction (all four gates, once ever, milestones, gang
`recruit` progress, agent_flag excluded, same-IP flagged). Telemetry (§12) via
`track()`. Mod tools (§10.3) behind the `MOD_KEY` header: ban (blocks at auth),
mod-kill (estate without a killer), confiscate (→ buyback pool), audit view.

Discrepancies raised (prototype wins per ground rule #1): asset sell-back is **80%**
not spec's 70% (`economy.js:sellAsset`); gang joining is **immediate** (no apply/accept
queue — v24 `joinGang`); war duration **30 min** pending the §9 design call; the daily
pool draws **dice** contracts but there is no dice endpoint in spec §5 (undrawable-day
gap — needs a design call). Test-only env knobs `SEARCH_MS`/`SHOOT_CD_MS` shrink the
§9 hit timers — never set them in production.

M5 shipped alpha hardening. `src/invariants.js` is the §10.4 job: seven checks
(character cash, gang treasuries, bounty escrow, $OMR, cars, cb, ammo — each bucket
reconciled against a per-currency reason vocabulary; an unknown reason is itself an
alert) with telemetry + optional `INVARIANT_WEBHOOK_URL` alerting; the worker runs it
nightly and `GET /v1/mod/invariants` on demand. Every faucet/sink now has a row —
M5 closed the gaps (bank interest, bounty escrow split, death-cleared bounties,
forfeited exchange escrow, gang dissolution). `src/ratelimit.js`: §10.2 token buckets
(human 1/s burst 5, agent 1/3s hard, swaps 6/min; in-memory, Redis via `REDIS_URL`),
enabled in production or `RATE_LIMIT=on`; rates are read per-call, not at import.
Idempotency-Key is honored on all mutating player routes (stored responses replay
with `x-idempotent-replay`). `src/auth.js`: X sign-in (bearer → /2/users/me), Privy
(ES256 JWT vs app JWKS, needs `PRIVY_APP_ID`), guest→provider upgrade preserving the
account row, agent keys (`POST /v1/auth/agent-key` — permanent agent_flag + throttled
token), and the `INVITE_MODE=on` closed-alpha gate (codes minted via
`POST /v1/mod/invites`). Season rollover (§8) is `runSeasonRollover` in the worker:
level→prestige (floor(lvl/2)), respect reset, batched, telemetered. `tools/backup.sh`
is the nightly pg_dump. The hardening test's invariant scenario earns every dollar
through ledgered faucets — never SQL-seed cash/cb/ammo/$OMR in it.

A full red-team audit (`AUDIT.md`) hardened M1–M5: two §10.4 leaks closed (sub-cent
bank interest now ledgered; exchange cb/ammo escrow is an un-ledgered internal bucket
transfer, only `death:escrow` forfeiture is ledgered), concurrency-safe idempotency
(reserve-before-execute, 2xx-only, body-bound), DB-driven agent throttle, atomic
invite consume, `UNIQUE(auth_provider,auth_subject)`, mission $OMR once-per-account
(`mission_omr_claimed`), bounty `bounty_contributors` (no funder can collect), gang
row-lock on join, swap-sell/buyListing net-≤0 guards, referral lock order fixed,
banned-WS close, Privy JWT hardening, base58 wallet + uniqueness, living-name
uniqueness, and hot-path indexes. `test/security.js` has a regression per finding.
Three items left as design calls (turf goods arbitrage, daily same-kind draw + dice
contracts, per-IP throttle) — flagged in AUDIT.md, not patched per ground rule #1.

**M6 moved from Solana to Robinhood Chain (Arbitrum Orbit L2, EVM)** — see
`omerta-chain-migration-evm.md`. The spec §11 intent is unchanged (off-chain stays
authoritative; the chain settles withdrawals + ownership proofs; nothing mints), but
the mechanism is now EVM: EIP-712 signed vouchers (not Ed25519), ERC-1155 gear (not
Bubblegum cNFTs), ERC-20 OMR, an EVM DEX buyback (not Jupiter), and `balanceOf`/SIWE
holdings checks (not DAS).

M6-A (on-chain) is delivered in `omerta-contracts/` — a Foundry/Solidity suite:
`OMR` (inert fixed-supply ERC-20 + Permit), `VoucherClaim` (the only bridge —
EIP-712, replay-proof via nonce, deadline-bound, daily-capped, pausable,
tranche-funded), `GearVault` (ERC-1155, mint gated to VoucherClaim), `OMRStaking`
(pre-funded pool, 50% APY ceiling, principal always withdrawable). 15 Foundry tests
incl. fuzz. Its own `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` govern that subtree (`forge test` must
pass; nothing mints; no owner mint paths; no hardcoded chainIds).

Next: **M6-B (backend chain service, NOT built)** — isolated service whose only DB
write is the `vouchers` table; `POST /v1/withdraw` + gear mint that debit the ledger
and sign an EIP-712 voucher on **viem** in exact parity with `VOUCHER_TYPEHASH`; a
`Claimed` event watcher setting `claimed_onchain`; SIWE wallet verification; the
buyback bot. Devnet first, third-party audit of contracts **and** signer before
mainnet. Note flagged in review: `VoucherClaim`'s daily cap + tranche bound OMR
claims only — gear mints are uncapped, so a compromised signer can mint unlimited
gear (revocable by the Safe); treat as an audit-surface decision.

## Sensitive design notes
- $OMR framing is utility-only; never add mechanics implying price appreciation.
- Social/onboarding rewards pay in-game cash only, never $OMR (v24 rule).
- Agent-flagged accounts: excluded from referral payouts, harder rate limits, public badge.
